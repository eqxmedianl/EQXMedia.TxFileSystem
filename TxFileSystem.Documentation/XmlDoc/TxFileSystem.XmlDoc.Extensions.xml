                This is an operation that modifies one or more files, hence it is journalized. 
                Journalized file operations can either be rolled back or committed automatically, 
                restoring or removing the backup file(s), respectively. Whenever an <see 
                  cref="System.Exception"/> of any kind occurs, all journalized operations are 
                rolled back, resulting in the original state to be restored.
              </para>
              <para>
                If no <see cref="System.Exception"/> any kind occurs and the <see 
                cref="System.Transactions.TransactionScope" /> completes successfully, all journalized
                operations are committed. Any modifications made are then preserved and the backup file(s)
                are then removed.

              <para>
                This is an operation that doesn't modify any files, hence it is not journalized. As there
                is no need to rollback any modifications whenever an <see cref="System.Exception"/> of any
                kind occurs inside a <see cref="System.Transactions.TransactionScope" />.
