                This is a file modifying operation, hence it is journalized. Journalized file operations can 
                either be rolled back or committed automatically, restoring or removing the backupped file(s), 
                respectively. Whenever any type <see cref="System.Exception"/> occurs all journalized operations
                are rolled back, otherwise they are all committed.
