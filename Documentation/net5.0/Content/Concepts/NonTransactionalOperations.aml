      <para>
        Non-transactional operations don't need to ensure data integrity is maintained by applications
        explicitly. These kind of operations simply don't modify any file system resources.

      <para>
        On this page non-transactional operations being part of
        <codeEntityReference linkText="TxFileSystem">T:EQXMedia.TxFileSystem.TxFileSystem"</codeEntityReference>
        are being explained.

        <para>
          In order to able to make use of the backup and restore mechanism used internally by this library,
          a transactional journal is used.
        </para>
        <para>
          All non-transactional operations performed using the methods of the properties exposed by
          <codeEntityReference linkText="TxFileSystem">T:EQXMedia.TxFileSystem.TxFileSystem"</codeEntityReference>,
          will never be listed inside the transactional journal.
        </para>
        <para>
          As said earlier in this topic so that these kind of operations simply don't modify any file system 
          resources. The result of not listing them inside the journal that is used for transactional operations, 
          is maximum performance and minimal overhead caused by using the library.
